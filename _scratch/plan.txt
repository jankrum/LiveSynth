THE ROLE OF THE SEQUENCER

Boot and try to connect to transporter
    -Prepare to respond to:
        -Loopback requests
            -Respond with Loopback call
        -Loopback calls
            -Respond with relevant state for transporter
                -FSM has to be loaded for this
        -Button Presses
            -Consult the finite state machine and respond with new transporter state
                -FSM has to be loaded for this

The finite state machine is an object that has:
    -data:
        -state: playing/paused/stopped
        -filesystem:
            -scripts: []
            -charts: []
        -chartIndex: 0
        -chartsLength: num
    -transitions
        -playing:
            -pause
                -Send pause instruction to player and wait
                -Set state to paused
                -Send state
            -stop
                -Send stop instruction to player and wait
                -Set state to stopped
                -Send state
        -paused:
            -play
                -Send resume instruction to player and wait
                -Set state to playing
                -Send state
            -stop
                -Send pause instruction to player and wait
                -Set state to stopped
                -Send state
        -stopped:
            -play
                -Send play instruction to player and wait
                -Set state to playing
                -Send state
    -methods:
        -sendState
            -calculates and returns a SYSEX message representing transporter state
        -previous
            -Check if we can move previous
            -If not stopped, send stop instruction to player and wait
            -Load new chart into player and wait
            -Decrement chartIndex
            -Set state to stopped
            -Send state
        -next
            -Check if we can move next
            -If not stopped, send stop instruction to player and wait
            -Load new chart into player and wait
            -Increment chartIndex
            -Set state to stopped
            -Send state
